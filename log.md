# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Bought a couple of JavaScript courses (Learn JavaScript: Full-Stack from Scratch and Advanced JavaScript Concepts) and a React course (Complete React Developer in 2019(w/Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)) from Udemy. They, as well as my "Node.js, Mongo DB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2019" and "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" will keep me busy for a while. Started to learn Node. I never really understood it, but now I have someone to teach me. Did some CSS tinkering on my Vue.js learning page.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite excited. Got a huge motivation boost from the FreeCodeCamp podcasts, so wish me luck! During Spring I learned the basics of JavaScript, but there's so much more to learn.

### Day 2: August 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned to read and write a file from directory and to create a web server. Wohoo! Created a Node Farm app, finishing "Introduction to Node.js and NPM".

**Thoughts:** I already have some experience from Node, but having a course teaching specifically about Node is really helping me to understand the concepts that were too difficult to me earlier. I also listened to the Ladybug Podcast and got some awesome ideas about it.

### Day 3: August 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Node bootcamp, added the bootcamp folder to Github, wrote a README and made this log a bit prettier(???)

**Thoughts**: Was having a bit of a lazy day, mainly because of a doctor's appointment that stressed me out more than it should have. While I'm tempted to just continue the Node Bootcamp I might test out my own skills before moving further in the bootcamp. While I enjoy doing what the teacher is doing, I really learn when I'm messing with the code by myself.

### Day 4: August 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Had some great fun with CSS and CSS animations! Started the Advanced CSS course to get the feeling of CSS again, then went to create some fun small CSS animations of my own.

**Thoughts**: I had great fun doing animations. After working I was surprised I was able to actually get myself to study and create something. I'm feeling really good! Sometimes it's nice to do something not-so-serious.
