# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Bought a couple of JavaScript courses (Learn JavaScript: Full-Stack from Scratch and Advanced JavaScript Concepts) and a React course (Complete React Developer in 2019(w/Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)) from Udemy. They, as well as my "Node.js, Mongo DB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2019" and "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" will keep me busy for a while. Started to learn Node. I never really understood it, but now I have someone to teach me. Did some CSS tinkering on my Vue.js learning page.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite excited. Got a huge motivation boost from the FreeCodeCamp podcasts, so wish me luck! During Spring I learned the basics of JavaScript, but there's so much more to learn.

**Today's Progress**: Learned to read and write a file from directory and to create a web server. Wohoo! Created a Node Farm app, finishing "Introduction to Node.js and NPM".

**Thoughts:** I already have some experience from Node, but having a course teaching specifically about Node is really helping me to understand the concepts that were too difficult to me earlier. I also listened to the Ladybug Podcast and got some awesome ideas about it.
