# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Bought a couple of JavaScript courses (Learn JavaScript: Full-Stack from Scratch and Advanced JavaScript Concepts) and a React course (Complete React Developer in 2019(w/Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)) from Udemy. They, as well as my "Node.js, Mongo DB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2019" and "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" will keep me busy for a while. Started to learn Node. I never really understood it, but now I have someone to teach me. Did some CSS tinkering on my Vue.js learning page.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite excited. Got a huge motivation boost from the FreeCodeCamp podcasts, so wish me luck! During Spring I learned the basics of JavaScript, but there's so much more to learn.

### Day 2: August 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned to read and write a file from directory and to create a web server. Wohoo! Created a Node Farm app, finishing "Introduction to Node.js and NPM".

**Thoughts:** I already have some experience from Node, but having a course teaching specifically about Node is really helping me to understand the concepts that were too difficult to me earlier. I also listened to the Ladybug Podcast and got some awesome ideas about it.

### Day 3: August 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Node bootcamp, added the bootcamp folder to Github, wrote a README and made this log a bit prettier(???)

**Thoughts**: Was having a bit of a lazy day, mainly because of a doctor's appointment that stressed me out more than it should have. While I'm tempted to just continue the Node Bootcamp I might test out my own skills before moving further in the bootcamp. While I enjoy doing what the teacher is doing, I really learn when I'm messing with the code by myself.


### Day 4: August 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Had some great fun with CSS and CSS animations! Started the Advanced CSS course to get the feeling of CSS again, then went to create some fun small CSS animations of my own.

**Thoughts**: I had great fun doing animations. After working I was surprised I was able to actually get myself to study and create something. I'm feeling really good! Sometimes it's nice to do something not-so-serious.

### Day 5: August 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to wrap my head around Node.js Event loops and requests, etc. Also played with the animations a little bit more, but nothing too significant.

**Thoughts**: I really want to understand what happens in the server side but goshdarnit it's hard. I'm glad I'm over the more theoretical videos soon, because in my current exhausted mindset it just goes over my head.


### Day 6: August 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practicing Node.js events, streams and modules. Also tried to learn to use Github. Started to gain more knowledge about Asyncronous JavaScript, will continue and finish that part tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Not a very exciting few days but it's ok. Learning isn't all the time fun and games. I want to go back to normal JavaScript, HTML and CSS but I really want to learn Node.js! Already have some nice projects in mind!


### Day 7: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the whole day practicing promises and Asyncronous JavaScript. Also something like 2 hours was used to try to find an error in the code, which ended up being 'fata' instead of 'data'.

**Thoughts**: First I didn't know what to expect of promises but I actually like them. They feel like they make sense. Can't wait to get to the doing parts of the tutorial so I can start also slowly building my own project. I could already do the HTML and CSS part of it, but I'm saving it for the days Node.js feels like eating cardboard. ;)


### Day 8: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went through JavaScript basics, made a really simple to do list.

**Thoughts**: I realized I didn't remember much from my previous JavaScript courses from this spring, so I went through the basics. Wasn't very exciting but I'm happy I did because I had already forgotten so much. At this point in my 100 days of coding it doesn't hurt to go back to the beginnings to get further in the world of code.

### Day 9: August 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went through the Node.js basics, installed Express and tried to learn more about it. Also started a MongoDB project, where I create a database for my old to-do app.

**Thoughts**: Very excited about the MongoDB even though it's really difficult to understand at first. However, updating old projects is always fun. First I will create a database to it so it will finally work as intended and later I will update its horrible CSS! Win-win all the way.


### Day 10: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got the to-do list to send text items to a MongoDB database and show them in the console, but couldn't figure out how to put them in the HTML code to get the to-do item. Spent a couple of hours not sure what to google to get useful results I could use. Later set up my laptop so I can learn CSS while not at home.

**Thoughts**: The Server-Client-Website problem is really frustrating and I need to sit on it for a while. Also had a lot of updates on my computer waiting for me, so most of my free time was wasted on updates. However, everything is set up for tomorrow.


### Day 11: August 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do any work on computer, but rather spent the whole day meeting with people from the finnish Girls Who Code community called #Mimmitkoodaa. Also talked to many local tech companies and asked about job opportunities and what they expect from a candidate and employee.

**Thoughts**: Had a really fun an super motivating day. I have so many different goals to go towards but they all lie at the end of the "learn to code" road. Slowly but steadily getting there. The speeches really gave me strength to try harder and with more resilience! 

### Day 12: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the theory part of my CSS tutorials about inheritance, specifity and workflow. I also applied to some web courses at university about DevOps and Service design.

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit of a lazy day mainly because I don't really enjoy working on laptop while not having a proper space. Tomorrow back on my desktop computer ⭐️

### Day 13: September 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned to use SASS (or rather SCSS).

**Thoughts**: Sass is going to make handling CSS much more easier in the future projects, so I'm glad I finally learned about the syntax used. I really want to start doing my own projects but I'm scared my knowledge isn't good enough.

### Day 14: September 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: A little bit of Sass and a whole lot more CSS Grid. I got excited and made a FreeCodeCamp Tribute page project, for Mary Anning.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed learning and planning my Tribute page. Also, learning more about Mary Anning is always fun.

### Day 15: September 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nothing much. Mainly trying to understand Git because it's still a mystery to me.

**Thoughts**: First day of work after a week of vacation took a toll on my energy levels. I will most likely try to continue to learn Node, Express and MongoDB since they are useful and interesting. 

### Day 16: September 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Going through the Freecodecamp Javascript part, to refresh my memory and there are things I never really lerned, like switches. 

**Thoughts**: I'm preparing to do some serious JavaScripting to learn the language better. Tomorrow I'll also attend a JavaScript meeting at Tampere.

### Day 17: September 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic JavaScript tutorials, moved to ES6

**Thoughts**: Ended up not going to the JavaScript meeting because of not feeling very good. Also got a bit distracted by my new art supplies I had been waiting for far too long. 

### Day 18: September 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: A little bit of ES6 before getting frustrated

**Thoughts**: I might have a JavaScript free day or week to refresh my mind, some of the Freecodecamp's challenges make me really frustrated when I don't understand the assignment and have to peek for the answers to understand. Might try Python a bit.

### Day 19: September 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn Python on Kaggle

**Thoughts**: Python is much easier to read than JavaScript which is a nice change without it being completely different from other bits of coding language I know!

### Day 20: September 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned Python Booleans and Conditional

**Thoughts**: Had a bit lazy day meeting friends and all

### Day 21: September 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Python Lists and Loops

**Thoughts**: For some reason wrapping my mind around the loops has been really hard. A couple of times I tried a some sort of JavaScript solution but that didn't work out (surprise surprise!)

### Day 22: September 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lists and Loops (or rather gave up for now) and tried to learn about Strings. 

**Thoughts**: "Easy enough" I thought, then faced the problem of trying to find a certain string from an array. Why is my brain not working?

### Day 23: September 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lists and Loops (or rather gave up for now) and tried to learn about Strings. 

**Thoughts**: "Easy enough" I thought, then faced the problem of trying to find a certain string from an array. Why is my brain not working?

### Day 24: September 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Didn't progress in coding but had my first online university course about Web Service Design.

**Thoughts**: Quite happy about the course, it will be interesting to create first a design of an interactive web site. In later courses we fully create the web site.

### Day 25: September 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished learning about Python lists

**Thoughts**: Got inspired to continue my Front End journey.

### Day 26: September 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Listened to a lot of inspiring podcasts, but didn't get a lot of progress done.

**Thoughts**: I got really inspired by the FreeCodeCamp podcast and STart Here Web Development podcast. They gave me lots of new energy to continue.

### Day 27: September 15, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Did Node/Express/Postman tutorial a bit further

**Thoughts**: I'm having a lot of ideas for the future projects, the only trick is to actually do them.

### Day 28: September 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos #Javascript30 and made a Basic Drum Kit. Also started to plan a new and better design for my personal portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Got really inspired by Gary Keller's book The One Thing. It's basically about how you should focus on one thing and do it better rather than work on multiple things and do them all badly. Also, apparently new habits are formed in like 66 days. Still a long way to go and it takes so much willpower to code somedays, but I know it will most likely give me better life, so the thought keeps me going.

### Day 29: September 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did the CSS + JS clock from #Javascript30, started React basics and learned Flexbox with Flexbox Froggy

**Thoughts**: Today was quite productive day. The JavaScript30 is quite fun since it offers small but still interesting tutorials that don't take much time.
